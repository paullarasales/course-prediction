Course Prediction in Python

Overview

The Course Prediction project is a Python-based application designed to predict the best courses for students based on their interests, skills, and academic performance. By leveraging data analysis and machine learning, this project provides personalized course recommendations to help students make informed decisions about their education.

Features

Analyze student data such as grades, interests, and skillsets.

Use machine learning models to predict suitable courses.

Provide recommendations tailored to individual student profiles.

Visualize data trends and predictions for better understanding.

Requirements

Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8 or later

pip (Python package installer)

Libraries

Install the required Python libraries by running:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Key Libraries:

pandas - for data manipulation and analysis

numpy - for numerical computations

scikit-learn - for machine learning algorithms

matplotlib and seaborn - for data visualization

flask (optional) - for deploying the project as a web application

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/paullarasales/course-prediction.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd course-prediction

Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Running Locally

Prepare the dataset:

Place your dataset in the data/ directory (e.g., data/student_data.csv).

Ensure the dataset includes relevant features such as grades, interests, and skills.

Execute the script:

python main.py

Follow the console prompts to input student data or analyze the dataset.

Web Application (Optional)

If using Flask for deployment:

Start the Flask server:

python app.py

Open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000.

Dataset

The project requires a dataset with features such as:

Student ID

Grades: Subject-wise marks or GPA

Interests: Categorized interests (e.g., Science, Arts, Technology)

Skills: Technical or soft skills

Ensure that the dataset is preprocessed or cleaned before running the scripts.

Machine Learning

The project uses the following machine learning techniques:

Classification Algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees) to predict the most suitable courses.

Clustering Algorithms (e.g., K-Means) to group students with similar profiles.

Model training and evaluation are handled in src/model.py. You can experiment with different algorithms and hyperparameters.
